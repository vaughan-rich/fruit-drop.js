## Fruit-Drop.js üçé

Fruit-Drop.js is an HTML Canvas game and my first foray into object orientated programming and writing javascript.

## How to Play

You can play Fruit-Drop.js <a href="http://richvaughan.co.uk/pages/fruit-drop/fruit-drop.html">here</a>. It's recommended you play either in Chrome or Firefox (where it's been tested successfully). You may experience some audio latency/performance issues in other browsers.

Otherwise, you can download the source code above and run it natively in your browser of choice for ultimate performance! üëä

## To Add In Future Versions
* Improve cross-compatibility between browsers - fixing audio latency and performance issues
* Tweak object spawning positions, spawning frequency and acceleration for improved gameplay.
* Refine and optimise game update alogrithm - remove repeated code and pack up into functions for tidiness/readability
* Improve collision detection (remove hardcoded player width modifier values etc)
* Add a function that saves and displays your high score
* Animated sprites (basket filling up, an animated health bar, 'splat' effects, etc)
* Introduce powerups? (bigger paddle, change speed, x2 score etc for limited time)
* Add button to share score and game link to fb
* Possibly add touch capability (or port to iOS app)
* Any necessary bug fixes
