# Fruit-Drop.js 🍎

Fruit-Drop.js is an HTML Canvas game and my first foray into object orientated programming and writing javascript.

# How to Play

You can play Fruit-Drop.js <a href="http://richvaughan.co.uk/pages/fruit-drop/fruit-drop.html">here</a>. It's recommended you play either in Chrome or Firefox (where it's been tested successfully). You may experience some audio latency/performance issues in other browsers.

Otherwise, you can download the source code above and run it natively in your browser of choice for ultimate performance! 👊
